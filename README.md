### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Marina and I am junior front-end developer.
- ğŸ’… Iâ€™m currently working on my first portfolio.
- ğŸŒ± Now I'm actively learning JavaScript, React, and TypeScript.
- ğŸŒº During my time at university, I gained a solid foundation in Python and Bash, laying the groundwork for my programming journey.
